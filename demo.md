Tests are suggested based on what the specified server claims it can do in its conformance report

To see this, click on the tab labeled "Conformance"

This is the information we found in the conformance report for your server, as you can see it specifies what actions it supports for various resources

Go back to the tab labeled "Tests"

This is where you can review the tests we will be running against your server, we've populated this list for you based on the conformance but if you know it's wrong you can run whichever set of tests you think you should run.

Click "Run Tests"

The tests will be run on your server and the results will show up at this page

From here you can review the test results for your server.

There are three options for viewing the results; a list of all run tests, a grid of resources based on your conformance report, and a heat map showing what portions of the spec we are testing.

Here you can see the list of all tests that were run, their results, and can click to expand for more information on what the test is checking.
